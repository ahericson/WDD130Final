      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Julius Sans One  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I have chosen this font because I liked how modern it looked. I felt that it matched the soothing and calm colors that were chosen for the color palette.
        I also liked how it would stand out on the web page due to it being in all caps and the amount of spacing in between each letter makes it broader and easy to see. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lato  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font for the paragraphs on the website because of how well it contrasts with the heading font - it is simple, easy to read, and matches the sans-serif theme
        comparible to the lettering in the heading. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>

      <h3>What is Boba?</h3>
      <p>
        What are Boba Drinks? <br>
Boba, also known as Tapioca Pearls, are made from Tapioca! But boba drinks do not just consist of tapioca, there are many other toppings that can be included in Boba drinks. For example, many can enjoy their boba drinks with Azuki Bean (sweet red bean), fruit flavored jellies, fruit-flavored popping boba, ice cream, cheese foam, fresh fruit, and more! These different toppings provide different sorts of textures and flavors that can be enjoyed with any drink base. <br>
A Delicious Combination <br>
What about the “drink” portion of boba beverages? Well, the tapioca pearls and toppings themselves are only just half of it! Boba beverages usually consist of a base beverage where the toppings are put into. These base drinks complete the entire package! Many of the drinks that can be combined with boba toppings include flavored milk tea, flavored smoothies, and flavored Icey beverages. These flavored beverages can also be ordered hot, and without any boba toppings! The variations are up to you. <br>
The Old and the New <br>
There are many flavors that your base beverage can come in! Some may be flavors that are already common such as vanilla, chocolate, cookies n’ cream, or strawberry. But, if you are feeling adventurous, you can also try more exotic flavors such as Taro, Red Bean, Lychee, Passion Fruit, or Honey Dew! Whichever you decide, you are sure to have a good experience!

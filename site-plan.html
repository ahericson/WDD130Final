        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/d8e2dc-ffe5d9-f4acb7-9d8189" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/d8e2dc-ffe5d9-f4acb7-9d8189</a>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Julius Sans One  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I have chosen this font because I liked how modern it looked. I felt that it matched the soothing and calm colors that were chosen for the color palette.
        I also liked how it would stand out on the web page due to it being in all caps and the amount of spacing in between each letter makes it broader and easy to see. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lato  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font for the paragraphs on the website because of how well it contrasts with the heading font - it is simple, easy to read, and matches the sans-serif theme
        comparible to the lettering in the heading. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

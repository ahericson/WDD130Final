           Some people may not be familiar with Boba beverages, but the popularity of these versatile drinks is on the rise. 
           People of all ages can enjoy this treat, and although there are many options to choose from, it is not as confusing as it may seem.

              <h2 class="section-header-1">What is Boba?</h2>
          <p>
            Boba, also known as Tapioca Pearls, are made from Tapioca! But boba drinks do not just consist of tapioca, 
            there are many other toppings that can be included in Boba drinks. 
            For example, many can enjoy their boba drinks with Azuki Bean (sweet red bean), fruit flavored jellies, 
            fruit-flavored popping boba, ice cream, cheese foam, fresh fruit, and more! 
            These different toppings provide different sorts of textures and flavors that can be enjoyed with any drink base. 
          </p>
         <h2 class="section-header-2">A Delicious Combination</h2>
         <p>
           What about the “drink” portion of boba beverages? Well, the tapioca pearls and toppings themselves are only just half of it! 
           Boba beverages usually consist of a base beverage where the toppings are put into. These base drinks complete the entire package! 
           Many of the drinks that can be combined with boba toppings include flavored milk tea (a milk-based drink w/o tea), flavored smoothies, and flavored Icey beverages. 
           These flavored beverages can also be ordered hot, and without any boba toppings! The variations are up to you.
